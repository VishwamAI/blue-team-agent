3. **Threat Detection**: Automated threat hunting is performed using Seculyze and Caldera.
4. **Incident Response**: Detected threats trigger incident response playbooks from Societé Generale.
5. **System Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring is performed using Sysmon and maltrail.
6. **Vulnerability Management**: Regular vulnerability scans are conducted using OpenVAS and Nessus Essentials.

### Integration
- **Centralized Dashboard**: A centralized dashboard is created using Kibana to provide a unified view of all security events and actions.
- **Automation Orchestration**: XSOAR is used to orchestrate automation workflows and integrate various tools.

## Reinforcement Learning Model
### Model Components
- **State Representation**: The state is represented by metrics extracted from log data, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, packet rate, connection count, anomaly score, intrusion alerts, and firewall logs. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the system's current status and potential security threats.
- **Action Space**: The agent can perform a variety of actions, including blocking or allowing an IP address, applying rate limiting, isolating a system, sending alerts, running malware scans, changing firewall settings, updating software, searching logs, and generating reports. These actions enable the agent to respond effectively to different security scenarios.
- **Neural Network**: A neural network model is used to predict the best action based on the current state. The model is trained using reinforcement learning techniques to improve its decision-making over time.

### Training Loop
The main training loop involves the following steps:
1. **Reset Environment**: The environment is reset to its initial state, ensuring a consistent starting point for each training episode.
2. **Choose Action**: The agent chooses an action based on the current state using its neural network model. The action is selected to maximize the expected reward.
3. **Execute Action**: The chosen action is executed, and the environment provides feedback in the form of a reward or penalty.
4. **Update Model**: The agent updates its model based on the feedback received, adjusting its predictions to improve future performance.
5. **Repeat**: The loop repeats for a specified number of episodes, with the agent learning and improving over time. The training process continues until the agent achieves satisfactory performance.

## Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: Flask, gym, tensorflow, requests, numpy

### Setup
1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask gym tensorflow requests numpy
   ```
2. Start the mock server:
   ```bash
   python3 mock_server.py
   ```
3. Run the RL agent script:
   ```bash
   python3 rl_agent_model.py
   ```

## Training the Model with Data from the Internet
### Data Sources
To enhance the blue team agent's intelligence, you can train the model with data from various internet sources. Some potential data sources include:
- **OpenPhish**: Provides phishing URLs and related data.
- **Kaggle Datasets**: Offers a wide range of cybersecurity-related datasets.
- **CISA Feeds**: Provides threat intelligence feeds from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
- **VirusTotal**: Offers data on malware and other security threats.
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Provides a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques.

### Fetching Data
Use the `requests` library to fetch data from the selected sources. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and API keys to access the data.

Example code to fetch data:
```python
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/data"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
else:
    print("Failed to fetch data:", response.status_code)
```

### Preprocessing Data
Preprocess the fetched data to convert it into a format suitable for training the model. This may involve cleaning the data, extracting relevant features, and normalizing values.

Example code to preprocess data:
```python
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Implement data preprocessing steps here
    processed_data = []
    for item in data:
        # Extract relevant features and normalize values
        processed_item = {
            "feature1": item["raw_feature1"] / 100,
            "feature2": item["raw_feature2"] / 50,
            # Add more feature extraction and normalization steps as needed
        }
        processed_data.append(processed_item)
    return processed_data
```

### Training the Model
Update the `convert_log_to_state` function to handle the new data format and train the model using the preprocessed data. Optimize hyperparameters and implement continuous learning to improve the model's performance over time.

Example code to train the model:
```python
def train_model(data):
    # Implement model training steps here
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        state = convert_log_to_state(data[episode])
        action = model.predict(state)
        reward, next_state = execute_action(action)
        model.update(state, action, reward, next_state)
```

### Continuous Learning
Enable continuous learning by periodically fetching new data and retraining the model. This ensures the agent stays up-to-date with the latest threats and adapts to new security scenarios.

Example code for continuous learning:
```python
import time

while True:
    new_data = fetch_data()
    preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(new_data)
    train_model(preprocessed_data)
    time.sleep(3600)  # Wait for an hour before fetching new data
```

### Logging and Monitoring
Enhance logging to provide better visibility into the training process and the agent's performance. Monitor the agent's actions and decisions to ensure it is learning and improving as expected.

### Simulated Events and Actions
- The agent can handle various types of simulated security events, such as:
  - Simulated security event log data
  - Simulated intrusion attempt detected
- For each event, the agent processes the log data, converts it into a state, chooses an appropriate action, and executes it.
- The actions the agent can take include:
  - Blocking or allowing an IP address
  - Applying rate limiting
  - Isolating a system
  - Sending alerts
  - Running malware scans
  - Changing firewall settings
  - Updating software
  - Searching logs
  - Generating reports

### Interpreting Output
- The agent's actions and decisions are printed to the console, providing real-time feedback on its performance.
- Success and error messages indicate the outcome of each action, helping users understand the agent's behavior.
- Performance metrics, such as total reward and epsilon value, are displayed for each episode, allowing users to monitor the agent's learning progress.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Elasticsearch Connection Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Logstash errors indicating connection issues with Elasticsearch.
   - **Solution**: Ensure Elasticsearch is running and accessible. Check the `logstash.conf` file for correct Elasticsearch host and port configuration. Verify network connectivity between Logstash and Elasticsearch.

2. **Grok Pattern Matching Failures**:
   - **Symptom**: Logstash fails to parse syslog messages.
   - **Solution**: Verify the grok patterns in the `logstash.conf` file. Use the `test_grok_patterns.py` script to test and validate the patterns. Ensure the syslog messages conform to the expected format.

3. **ModuleNotFoundError**:
   - **Symptom**: Missing Python modules when running scripts.
   - **Solution**: Install the required Python libraries using `pip install Flask gym tensorflow requests numpy`. Double-check the installation paths and Python environment.

3. **How does the RL agent learn?**
   - The RL agent uses a reinforcement learning model to learn from interactions with the environment. It updates its model based on feedback received from executing actions and improves its decision-making over time.

4. **How can I monitor the agent's performance?**
   - The agent's actions, decisions, and performance metrics are printed to the console. You can monitor the total reward, epsilon value, and other metrics for each episode.
