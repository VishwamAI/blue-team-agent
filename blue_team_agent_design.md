- **Description**: Automating vulnerability scans to identify and remediate security weaknesses in the system.

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Data Collection**: Logs and network data are collected using Logstash and Wireshark.
2. **Data Analysis**: Collected data is analyzed using Splunk and Kibana for visualization and threat detection.
3. **Threat Detection**: Automated threat hunting is performed using Seculyze and Caldera.
4. **Incident Response**: Detected threats trigger incident response playbooks from Societé Generale.
5. **System Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring is performed using Sysmon and maltrail.
6. **Vulnerability Management**: Regular vulnerability scans are conducted using OpenVAS and Nessus Essentials.

### Integration
- **Centralized Dashboard**: A centralized dashboard will be created using Kibana to provide a unified view of all security events and actions.
- **Automation Orchestration**: XSOAR will be used to orchestrate automation workflows and integrate various tools.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Tool Selection and Configuration**: Select and configure the necessary tools for each component.
2. **Integration**: Integrate the tools to ensure seamless data flow and automation.
3. **Testing**: Test the blue team agent in a controlled environment to validate its functionality.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the agent in the production environment.
5. **Documentation**: Document the usage and capabilities of the blue team agent.
6. **Review and Refinement**: Review the agent's performance and make necessary refinements based on feedback.

## Recent Updates
### Model 3.0 Development
- **Overview**: The blue-team-agent model 3.0 aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of blue team operations by leveraging advanced deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) techniques.
- **Key Advancements**: Incorporates DQN, DDPG, PPO, TRPO, and SAC algorithms for robust and efficient learning.
- **Architecture**: Includes input layer for high-dimensional sensory inputs, convolutional layers for feature extraction, fully-connected layers for learning complex representations, and an output layer for Q-values.
- **Training Techniques**: Utilizes experience replay, target networks, stochastic gradient descent, and an epsilon-greedy strategy.
- **Hyperparameters**: Discount factor (gamma) of 0.99, learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 32, replay memory size of 1,000,000, epsilon annealed from 1.0 to 0.1, and training over 10,000,000 frames.
- **Testing Procedures**: Includes unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, simulated security scenarios, and performance evaluation.

### CI/CD Pipeline Updates
- **Overview**: The CI/CD pipeline has been updated to ensure that the Docker container is used correctly for running the tests.
- **Debugging Efforts**: Added detailed print statements in the `train_model` function of `rl_agent_model.py` to track weight changes during training.
- **Current Focus**: Resolving the `AssertionError` in the `test_target_model_update` function by ensuring the target model's weights are updated as expected.

## Conclusion
This design document provides a comprehensive plan for building a blue team agent with automation capabilities. By leveraging the outlined tools and best practices, the agent will enhance the security posture of the organization and streamline incident response processes. The recent updates to model 3.0 and the CI/CD pipeline ensure that the agent is equipped with the latest advancements in reinforcement learning and is thoroughly tested for reliability and performance.
