# Model 3.0 Design Document

## Overview
The blue-team-agent model 3.0 aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of blue team operations by leveraging advanced deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) techniques. This document outlines the proposed architecture and improvements based on the latest advancements in Deep RL.

## Key Advancements
The following key advancements in Deep RL will be incorporated into model 3.0:
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Utilizes a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function, enabling the agent to learn value-based policies directly from raw sensory inputs. Experience replay and target networks stabilize training and improve sample efficiency.
- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**: Designed for continuous action spaces, combining deep Q-learning with deterministic policy gradients to learn value and policy functions simultaneously. Utilizes an actor-critic architecture.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A policy gradient method that addresses unstable policy updates by using a clipped surrogate objective. Balances sample efficiency and ease of implementation, known for its robustness and stability.
- **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**: Improves the stability of policy gradient methods by enforcing a trust region constraint, ensuring stable policy updates.
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: An off-policy actor-critic algorithm that optimizes a stochastic policy, maximizing a trade-off between expected return and entropy, leading to exploration in high-dimensional action spaces.

## Proposed Architecture
The proposed architecture for model 3.0 will incorporate elements from the DQN, DDPG, PPO, TRPO, and SAC algorithms to create a robust and efficient model for blue team operations.

### Neural Network Architecture
- **Input Layer**: The input layer will process high-dimensional sensory inputs, such as raw pixel data from security tools.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Two convolutional layers with rectifier nonlinearity to extract features from the input data.
- **Fully-Connected Layers**: Two fully-connected layers with 256 rectifier units each to learn complex representations.
- **Output Layer**: A fully-connected linear layer with a single output for each valid action, representing the Q-values.

### Training Techniques
- **Experience Replay**: Store the agent's experiences in a replay memory and randomly sample from it to train the model, reducing correlations between samples and stabilizing training.
- **Target Networks**: Use target networks to stabilize training by providing fixed Q-value targets for a period of time.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Optimize the loss function using stochastic gradient descent with minibatches.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**: Balance exploration and exploitation using an epsilon-greedy strategy, with epsilon annealed over time.
