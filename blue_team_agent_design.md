# Blue Team Agent Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and components of a blue team agent designed to automate various security tasks, including threat detection, incident response, system health monitoring, and patch management.

## Components

### 1. SOC Automation
- **Tools**: XSOAR, Intezer, Torq, Swimlane
- **Capabilities**: Automated alert handling, incident triage, response actions
- **Description**: Implementing a set of automation capabilities inspired by Tines' SOC Automation Capability Matrix.

### 2. Incident Response Playbooks
- **Tools**: Societé Generale incident response playbooks
- **Capabilities**: Automated responses to common security incidents
- **Description**: Utilizing playbooks to automate responses to incidents such as phishing, malware infections, and unauthorized access.

### 3. Log Management and Analysis
- **Tools**: Wireshark, Splunk, Kibana, Logstash
- **Capabilities**: Network analysis, data visualization, data collection
- **Description**: Integrating tools for comprehensive log management and analysis to detect and investigate security events.

### 4. Threat Hunting and Incident Response
- **Tools**: Seculyze, Caldera, Blue Team Training Toolkit
- **Capabilities**: Automated threat hunting, adversary emulation, realistic attack scenario creation
- **Description**: Incorporating tools for continuous threat hunting and security testing to identify and mitigate threats.

### 5. Security Monitoring
- **Tools**: Sysmon, maltrail, velociraptor
- **Capabilities**: System monitoring, malicious traffic detection
- **Description**: Setting up tools to monitor system activities and detect malicious behavior in real-time.

### 6. Vulnerability Management
- **Tools**: OpenVAS, Nessus Essentials, Nexpose
- **Capabilities**: Vulnerability scanning, management
- **Description**: Automating vulnerability scans to identify and remediate security weaknesses in the system.

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Data Collection**: Logs and network data are collected using Logstash and Wireshark.
2. **Data Analysis**: Collected data is analyzed using Splunk and Kibana for visualization and threat detection.
3. **Threat Detection**: Automated threat hunting is performed using Seculyze and Caldera.
4. **Incident Response**: Detected threats trigger incident response playbooks from Societé Generale.
5. **System Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring is performed using Sysmon and maltrail.
6. **Vulnerability Management**: Regular vulnerability scans are conducted using OpenVAS and Nessus Essentials.

### Integration
- **Centralized Dashboard**: A centralized dashboard will be created using Kibana to provide a unified view of all security events and actions.
- **Automation Orchestration**: XSOAR will be used to orchestrate automation workflows and integrate various tools.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Tool Selection and Configuration**: Select and configure the necessary tools for each component.
2. **Integration**: Integrate the tools to ensure seamless data flow and automation.
3. **Testing**: Test the blue team agent in a controlled environment to validate its functionality.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the agent in the production environment.
5. **Documentation**: Document the usage and capabilities of the blue team agent.
6. **Review and Refinement**: Review the agent's performance and make necessary refinements based on feedback.

## Conclusion
This design document provides a comprehensive plan for building a blue team agent with automation capabilities. By leveraging the outlined tools and best practices, the agent will enhance the security posture of the organization and streamline incident response processes.
